General:
 - [ ] Get user algorithm prompt input 
 - [ ] Use LLM to get code for algorithm
   - Function takes a string of the input from the user
   - Returns a list of lines of code that make up the algorithm
   - Separate returned algorithm into blocks
 - [ ] Replace each/some code blocks with comment 
   - If using LLM, should request to simplify
   - Keep track of blocks as drag & drop options
 - [ ] Future: generate 'red herring' options
 - [ ] Pass different components back to website
   - Comment interleaved code
   - Block options
 - [ ] Check if correct
   - Store prompt/answer as map?
 - [ ] FUTURE: If incorrect show explanation of different blocks (?)
 - [ ] FUTURE: If correct show visualisation (?)
 - [ ] FUTURE: Store previous prompts
